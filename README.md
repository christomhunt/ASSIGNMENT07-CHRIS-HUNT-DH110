## High Fidelity Prototype

### Project, Purpose, & Process

This is a high-fidelity prototype of the website musictheory.net (mobile version) created on Figma. The purpose of this is to test the features that were developed based on the personas of Dan and Emily.

The first task can be completed in either language English or Chinese (Simplified). From the lessons page start the first lesson “The Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines” then try and leave the lesson by clicking back, the flag, the X mark, the lesson tab, or the account tab. A prompt will show up and the user will be asked if they want to save their progress and make an account. The second task can be completed in either language English or Chinese (Simplified). From the lessons page click the flag, and you will be brought to a page where it shows 2 flags with boxes next to them that is empty. Click the box of the language which you want the page to be translated into and this will apply to all the pages you visit on the website.

### Task Supported by Interactive Prototype
