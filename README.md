## High Fidelity Prototype

### Project, Purpose, & Process

This is a high-fidelity prototype of the website musictheory.net (mobile version) created on Figma. The purpose of this is to test the features that were developed based on the personas of Dan and Emily.

The first task can be completed in either language English or Chinese (Simplified). From the lessons page start the first lesson “The Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines” then try and leave the lesson by clicking back, the flag, the X mark, the lesson tab, or the account tab. A prompt will show up and the user will be asked if they want to save their progress and make an account. The second task can be completed in either language English or Chinese (Simplified). From the lessons page click the flag, and you will be brought to a page where it shows 2 flags with boxes next to them that is empty. Click the box of the language which you want the page to be translated into and this will apply to all the pages you visit on the website.

### Task Supported by Interactive Prototype

- Task 1: Start a lesson and save your progress

- Task 2: Change language

### Cognitive Walkthrough

I conducted my cognitive walkthrough with the two partners I had in my group on Zoom (Justin and Chantal).

Summary of Walkthrough:

- Make 1/22 to percentage to show progress and make it bigger on the screen

- Get rid of the back button only make it go back during the lesson not leave the lesson

- Make descriptions bigger so it’s easier to read

### Iterations

Based on feedback from group mates I made those changes and ran a Usability Test with my dad.

Summary of UT Test with my dad:

- It was apparent right away that the progress bar was a progress bar

- The removal of the back button ability to make you leave the lesson was confusing

- The descriptions being bigger was a suggestion also made so maybe it wasn’t big enough

- The language changing format (clicking the flag) wasn’t the first choice my dad made when attempting to change the language
